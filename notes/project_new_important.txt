Starting work on a new project. Communication via Mattermost. Initial concept ready for December 13, 2021. We use vpn. Pages are inaccessible via vpn, so unfortunately StackOverflow has to be printed. Access only to internal pages, documentation. The customer cares about data security. Has data from multiple operators. We must ensure that the data from Orange are not made available to Plus and vice versa. Marcin has doubts about the firewall.
