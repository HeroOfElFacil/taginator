Unfortunately, we will have a slide in the project. The client is not able to issue the accesses on time. We will still have to make it by 04/10/2022. We came up with new ideas. We will probably implement Kubernetes. Piotr is not convinced of this idea. Yarn is sufficient for our situation. There can be problems with the arrival of customers, but no money for new machines. We need to discuss this with management. If they don't put money into new machines, the solution will be useless. We might as well run it on a toaster. Another meeting tomorrow, maybe something more will become clear. But at least one thing happened. You can now receive e-mail via vpn.
