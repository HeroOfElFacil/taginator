Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious respiratory and vascular disease[9] caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first case was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, though evidence suggests that the virus may have already been actively spreading months earlier in places such as Italy.[10][11]

Common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste.[6] Symptoms begin one to fourteen days after exposure to the virus.[12] While most people have mild symptoms, some people develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS can be precipitated by cytokine storms,[13] multi-organ failure, septic shock, and blood clots. Longer-term damage to organs (in particular, the lungs and heart) has been observed. There is concern about a significant number of patients who have recovered from the acute phase of the disease but continue to experience a range of effects—known as long COVID—for months afterwards. These effects include severe fatigue, memory loss and other cognitive issues, low grade fever, muscle weakness, and breathlessness.[14][15][16][17]

COVID-19 spreads via a number of means, primarily involving saliva and other bodily fluids and excretions. These fluids can form small droplets and aerosols, which can spread as an infected person breathes, coughs, sneezes, sings, or speaks. This is suspected to be the main mode of transmission. The virus may also spread via fomites (contaminated surfaces) and direct contact.[18][19] Infection mainly happens when people are near each other long enough.[a] It can spread as early as two days before infected persons show symptoms (presymptomatic), and from asymptomatic (no symptoms) individuals. People remain infectious for up to ten days in moderate cases, and two weeks in severe cases. The standard diagnosis method is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab.

Preventive measures include social distancing, quarantining, ventilation of indoor spaces, covering coughs and sneezes, hand washing, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face. The use of face masks or coverings has been recommended in public settings to minimise the risk of transmissions.

There are currently no proven vaccines or specific treatments for COVID-19, though several are in development. Management involves the treatment of symptoms, supportive care, isolation, and experimental measures.

The WHO, the Chinese National Health Commission, and the United States' National Institutes of Health have published recommendations for taking care of people who are hospitalised with COVID-19.[104][137][138] Intensivists and pulmonologists in the US have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.[139][140]

The severity of COVID-19 varies. The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold. Mild cases typically recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to recover. Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to eight weeks.[42] The Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanità reported that the median time between the onset of symptoms and death was twelve days, with seven being spent hospitalised. However, people transferred to an ICU had a median time of ten days between hospitalisation and death.[147]

According to scientific reviews smokers are more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-smokers,[148][149] air pollution is similarly associated with risk factors,[149] and pre-existing heart and lung diseases[150] and also obesity contributes to an increased health risk of COVID-19.[149][151][152]

It is also assumed that those that are immunocompromised are at higher risk of getting severely sick from SARS-CoV-2.[153] One research that looked into the COVID-19 infections in hospitalized kidney transplant recipients found a mortality rate of 11%.[154]
See also: Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children

Children make up a small proportion of reported cases, with about 1% of cases being under 10 years and 4% aged 10–19 years.[12] They are likely to have milder symptoms and a lower chance of severe disease than adults.

A European multinational study of hospitalized children published in The Lancet on 25 June 2020 found that about 8% of children admitted to a hospital needed intensive care. Four of those 582 children (0.7%) died, but the actual mortality rate could be "substantially lower" since milder cases that did not seek medical help were not included in the study.[155]

Mortality rates are highly correlated to age. In those younger than 50 years the risk of death is less than 0.5%, while in those older than 70 it is more than 8%.[156][157][158] According to a CDC analysis, the risk of death by age groups in the United States is 0.003%, 0.02%; 0.5% and 5.4% for the age groups 0–19, 20–49, 50–69, and 70 or over, respectively.[159][160]

Genetics also plays an important role in the ability to fight off the disease. For instance, those that do not produce detectable type I interferons or produce auto-antibodies against these may get much sicker from COVID-19.[161][162] Genetic screening is able to detect interferon effector genes.[163]

Pregnant women may be at higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection based on data from other similar viruses, like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), but data for COVID-19 is lacking.[164][165]
Historical COVID-19 CFR (%) by age and region
Comorbidities

Most of those who die of COVID-19 have pre-existing (underlying) conditions, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease.[212] According to March data from the United States, 89% of those hospitalised had preexisting conditions.[213] The Italian Istituto Superiore di Sanità reported that out of 8.8% of deaths where medical charts were available, 96.1% of people had at least one comorbidity with the average person having 3.4 diseases.[147] According to this report the most common comorbidities are hypertension (66% of deaths), type 2 diabetes (29.8% of deaths), ischemic heart disease (27.6% of deaths), atrial fibrillation (23.1% of deaths) and chronic renal failure (20.2% of deaths).

Most critical respiratory comorbidities according to the CDC, are: moderate or severe asthma, pre-existing COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, cystic fibrosis.[214] Evidence stemming from meta-analysis of several smaller research papers also suggests that smoking can be associated with worse patient outcomes.[215][216] When someone with existing respiratory problems is infected with COVID-19, they might be at greater risk for severe symptoms.[217] COVID-19 also poses a greater risk to people who misuse opioids and methamphetamines, insofar as their drug use may have caused lung damage.[218]

In August 2020 the CDC issued caution that tuberculosis infections could increase the risk of severe illness or death. The WHO recommended that patients with respiratory symptoms be screened for both diseases, as testing positive for COVID-19 couldn't rule out co-infections. Some projections have estimated that reduced TB detection due to the pandemic could result in 6.3 million additional TB cases and 1.4 million TB related deaths by 2025.[219]
Complications

Complications may include pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multi-organ failure, septic shock, and death.[75][220][221][222][223]

Cardiovascular complications may include heart failure, arrhythmias, heart inflammation, and blood clots.[224]

Approximately 20–30% of people who present with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes reflecting liver injury.[105][225]

Neurologic manifestations include seizure, stroke, encephalitis, and Guillain–Barré syndrome (which includes loss of motor functions).[226][227] Following the infection, children may develop paediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, which has symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease, which can be fatal.[228][229] In very rare cases, acute encephalopathy can occur, and it can be considered in those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have an altered mental status.[230]
Longer-term effects
Main article: Long Covid

Some early studies[231][232] suggest between 1 in 5 and 1 in 10 people with COVID-19 will experience symptoms lasting longer than a month. A majority of those who were admitted to hospital with severe disease report long-term problems including fatigue and shortness of breath.[233]

On 30 October 2020 WHO chief Tedros has warned that "to a significant number of people, the COVID virus poses a range of serious long-term effects". He has described the vast spectrum of COVID-19 symptoms that fluctuate over time as "really concerning." They range from fatigue, a cough and shortness of breath, to inflammation and injury of major organs – including the lungs and heart, and also neurological and psychologic effects. Symptoms often overlap and can affect any system in the body. Infected people have reported cyclical bouts of fatigue, headaches, months of complete exhaustion, mood swings and other symptoms. Tedros has underlined that therefore herd immunity is “morally unconscionable and unfeasible”.[234]
Immunity

The immune response by humans to CoV-2 virus occurs as a combination of the cell-mediated immunity and antibody production,[235] just as with most other infections.[236] However, it remains unknown if the immunity is long-lasting in people who recover from the disease.[needs update][237] Cases in which recovery from COVID-19 was followed by positive tests for coronavirus at a later date have been reported. In some of these cases, the RNA from the first and second infections indicates a different strain of the virus.[238][239][240][241] Some reinfection cases are believed to be lingering infection rather than reinfection,[241] or false positives due to remaining, non-infectious RNA fragments.[242] Some other coronaviruses circulating in people are capable of reinfection after roughly a year.[243]
History
Main article: Timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic

The virus is thought to be natural and has an animal origin,[39] through spillover infection.[244] The first known human infections were in Wuhan, Hubei, China. A study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, reported the earliest date of onset of symptoms as 1 December 2019.[245][246][247] Official publications from the WHO reported the earliest onset of symptoms as 8 December 2019.[248] Human-to-human transmission was confirmed by the WHO and Chinese authorities by 20 January 2020.[249][250] According to official Chinese sources, these were mostly linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sold live animals.[251] In May 2020, George Gao, the director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said animal samples collected from the seafood market had tested negative for the virus, indicating that the market was the site of an early superspreading event, but it was not the site of the initial outbreak.[252] Traces of the virus have been found in wastewater that was collected from Milan and Turin, Italy, on 18 December 2019.[253]

There are several theories about where the first case (the so-called patient zero) originated.[254] According to an unpublicised report from the Chinese government, the first case can be traced back to 17 November 2019; the person was a 55-year-old citizen in the Hubei province.[citation needed] There were four men and five women reported to be infected in November, but none of them were "patient zero".[citation needed] By December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.[142][255] The number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased, reaching 60 by 20 December[256] and at least 266 by 31 December.[257] On 24 December, Wuhan Central Hospital sent a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) sample from an unresolved clinical case to sequencing company Vision Medicals. On 27 and 28 December, Vision Medicals informed the Wuhan Central Hospital and the Chinese CDC of the results of the test, showing a new coronavirus.[258] A pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was observed on 26 December and treated by the doctor Zhang Jixian in Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.[259] On 30 December, a test report addressed to Wuhan Central Hospital, from company CapitalBio Medlab, stated an erroneous positive result for SARS, causing a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital to alert their colleagues and relevant hospital authorities of the result. That evening, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a notice to various medical institutions on "the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause".[260] Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang (punished on 3 January),[261] were later admonished by the police for spreading false rumours, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm.[262]

The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission made the first public announcement of a pneumonia outbreak of unknown cause on 31 December, confirming 27 cases[263][264][265]—enough to trigger an investigation.[266]

During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.[267] In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, helped by the Chinese New Year migration and Wuhan being a transport hub and major rail interchange.[42] On 20 January, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.[268] Later official data shows 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by then,[269] and more may have been infected.[270] A report in The Lancet on 24 January indicated human transmission, strongly recommended personal protective equipment for health workers, and said testing for the virus was essential due to its "pandemic potential".[58][271] On 30 January, the WHO declared the coronavirus a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.[270] By this time, the outbreak spread by a factor of 100 to 200 times.[272]

On 31 January 2020, Italy had its first confirmed cases, two tourists from China.[273] As of 13 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) considered Europe the active centre of the pandemic.[274] On 19 March 2020, Italy overtook China as the country with the most deaths.[275] By 26 March, the United States had overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.[276] Research on coronavirus genomes indicates the majority of COVID-19 cases in New York came from European travellers, rather than directly from China or any other Asian country.[277] Retesting of prior samples found a person in France who had the virus on 27 December 2019[278][279] and a person in the United States who died from the disease on 6 February 2020.[280]

On 11 June 2020, after 55 days without a locally transmitted case,[281] Beijing reported the first COVID-19 case, followed by two more cases on 12 June.[282] By 15 June 79 cases were officially confirmed.[283] Most of these patients went to Xinfadi Wholesale Market.[281][284]
Possible earlier cases

Research in Italy on samples from 959 volunteers in an experimental lung cancer treatment undertaken from September 2019 have shown COVID-19 anti-bodies in 14% of the samples. National Cancer Institute in Milan director Giovanni Apolone suggests that the major outbreak in Italy could have been caused because COVID-19 was wide spread in Italy from Summer 2019.[285]
Epidemiology
Main articles: COVID-19 pandemic and COVID-19 pandemic death rates by country

Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.[286] These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of testing, healthcare system quality, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health.[287]

The death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval. Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 2.4% (1,373,011/57,600,496) as of 21 November 2020.[8] The number varies by region.[288]

Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from a disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease. These statistics are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection through case resolution. Many academics have attempted to calculate these numbers for specific populations.[289]

Outbreaks have occurred in prisons due to crowding and an inability to enforce adequate social distancing.[290][291] In the United States, the prisoner population is aging and many of them are at high risk for poor outcomes from COVID-19 due to high rates of coexisting heart and lung disease, and poor access to high-quality healthcare.[290]

Infection fatality rate

Infection fatality rate or infection fatality ratio (IFR) is distinguished from case fatality rate (CFR). The CFR for a disease is the proportion of deaths from the disease compared to the total number of people diagnosed with the disease (within a certain period of time). The IFR, in contrast, is the proportion of deaths among all the infected individuals. IFR, unlike CFR, attempts to account for all asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections.

In February, the World Health Organization reported estimates of IFR between 0.3% and 1%.[294][295] On 2 July, The WHO's Chief Scientist reported that the average IFR estimate presented at a two-day WHO expert forum was about 0.6%.[296][297]

The CDC estimated for planning purposes that the IFR was 0.65% and that 40% of infected individuals are asymptomatic, suggesting a fatality rate among those who are symptomatic of 1.1% (.65/60) (as of 10 July).[298][299] Studies incorporating data from broad serology testing in Europe show IFR estimates converging at approximately 0.5–1%.[300] According to the University of Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM), random antibody testing in Germany suggested a national IFR of 0.4% (0.1% to 0.9%).[301][302][303]

Firm lower limits of IFRs have been established in a number of locations such as New York City and Bergamo in Italy since the IFR cannot be less than the population fatality rate. As of 10 July, in New York City, with a population of 8.4 million, 23,377 individuals (18,758 confirmed and 4,619 probable) have died with COVID-19 (0.3% of the population).[304] Antibody testing in New York City suggested an IFR of ~0.9%,[305] and ~1.4%.[306] In Bergamo province, 0.6% of the population has died.[307]
Sex differences
Main article: Gendered impact of the COVID-19 pandemic

Early reviews of epidemiologic data showed greater impact of the pandemic and a higher mortality rate in men in China and Italy.[1][308][309] The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the death rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.[310] Later reviews in June 2020 indicated that there is no significant difference in susceptibility or in CFR between genders.[311][312] One review acknowledges the different mortality rates in Chinese men, suggesting that it may be attributable to lifestyle choices such as smoking and drinking alcohol rather than genetic factors.[313] Sex-based immunological differences, lesser prevalence of smoking in women and men developing co-morbid conditions such as hypertension at a younger age than women could have contributed to the higher mortality in men.[314] In Europe, 57% of the infected people were men and 72% of those died with COVID-19 were men.[315] As of April 2020, the US government is not tracking sex-related data of COVID-19 infections.[316] Research has shown that viral illnesses like Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.[316]

Ethnic differences

In the US, a greater proportion of deaths due to COVID-19 have occurred among African Americans.[318] Structural factors that prevent African Americans from practicing social distancing include their concentration in crowded substandard housing and in "essential" occupations such as public transit and health care. Greater prevalence of lacking health insurance and care and of underlying conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and heart disease also increase their risk of death.[319] Similar issues affect Native American and Latino communities.[318] According to a US health policy non-profit, 34% of American Indian and Alaska Native People (AIAN) non-elderly adults are at risk of serious illness compared to 21% of white non-elderly adults.[320] The source attributes it to disproportionately high rates of many health conditions that may put them at higher risk as well as living conditions like lack of access to clean water.[321] Leaders have called for efforts to research and address the disparities.[322]

In the U.K., a greater proportion of deaths due to COVID-19 have occurred in those of a Black, Asian, and other ethnic minority background.[323][324][325]
Society and culture
Name

During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus",[326][327][328] with the disease sometimes called "Wuhan pneumonia".[329][330] In the past, many diseases have been named after geographical locations, such as the Spanish flu,[331] Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and Zika virus.[332]

In January 2020, the World Health Organization recommended 2019-nCov[333] and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease[334] as interim names for the virus and disease per 2015 guidance and international guidelines against using geographical locations (e.g. Wuhan, China), animal species, or groups of people in disease and virus names in part to prevent social stigma.[335][336][337]

The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued by the WHO on 11 February 2020.[338] WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained: CO for corona, VI for virus, D for disease and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified (31 December 2019).[339] The WHO additionally uses "the COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.[338]
Misinformation
Main article: Misinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic

After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, misinformation and disinformation regarding the origin, scale, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease rapidly spread online.[340][341][342]
Other animals

Humans appear to be capable of spreading the virus to some other animals, a type of disease transmission referred to as zooanthroponosis. A domestic cat in Liège, Belgium, tested positive after it started showing symptoms (diarrhoea, vomiting, shortness of breath) a week later than its owner, who was also positive.[343] Tigers and lions at the Bronx Zoo in New York, United States, tested positive for the virus and showed symptoms of COVID-19, including a dry cough and loss of appetite.[344] Minks at two farms in the Netherlands also tested positive for COVID-19.[345] In Denmark, as of October 31, 2020, 175 mink farms had seen COVID-19 infection in mink, and also USA; Finland, Sweden and Spain have seen infections in mink.[346][347]

A study on domesticated animals inoculated with the virus found that cats and ferrets appear to be "highly susceptible" to the disease, while dogs appear to be less susceptible, with lower levels of viral replication. The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.[348]

In March 2020, researchers from the University of Hong Kong have shown that Syrian hamsters could be a model organism for COVID-19 research.[349]

As of August 2020, dozens of domestic cats and dogs had tested positive, though according to the U.S. CDC, there was no evidence they transmitted the virus to humans.[350] CDC guidance recommends potentially infected people avoid close contact with pets.[350]

On 4 November 2020, Prime Minister of Denmark Mette Frederiksen stated that a mutated coronavirus was being transmitted to humans via minks, tied primarily to mink farms in Northern Jutland.[351]
Research
Further information: COVID-19 drug development

Remdesivir is the only drug that has been approved with a specific indication to treat COVID-19.[352] In Australia and the European Union, remdesivir (Veklury) is indicated for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults and adolescents (aged twelve years and older with body weight at least 40 kilograms (88 lb)) with pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen.[353][354][355] International research on vaccines and medicines in COVID-19 is underway by government organisations, academic groups, and industry researchers.[356][357] In March, the World Health Organization initiated the "Solidarity Trial" to assess the treatment effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promise of efficacy.[358] The World Health Organization suspended hydroxychloroquine from its global drug trials for COVID-19 treatments on 26 May 2020 due to safety concerns. It had previously enrolled 3,500 patients from 17 countries in the Solidarity Trial.[359] France, Italy and Belgium also banned the use of hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment.[360]

Remdesivir was approved for medical use in the United States in October 2020.[361][362] It is the first treatment for COVID-19 to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).[362] It is indicated for use in adults and adolescents (aged twelve years and older with body weight at least 40 kilograms (88 lb)) for the treatment of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization.[362]

Modelling research has been conducted with several objectives, including predictions of the dynamics of transmission,[363] diagnosis and prognosis of infection,[364] estimation of the impact of interventions,[365][366] or allocation of resources.[367] Modelling studies are mostly based on epidemiological models,[368] estimating the number of infected people over time under given conditions. Several other types of models have been developed and used during the COVID-19 including computational fluid dynamics models to study the flow physics of COVID-19,[369] retrofits of crowd movement models to study occupant exposure,[370] mobility-data based models to investigate transmission,[371] or the use of macroeconomic models to assess the economic impact of the pandemic.[372]

There has been a great deal of COVID-19 research, involving accelerated research processes and publishing shortcuts to meet the global demand.[373] To minimise the harm from misinformation, medical professionals and the public are advised to expect rapid changes to available information, and to be attentive to retractions and other updates.[374]
Vaccine
Main article: COVID-19 vaccine
In dark green are the countries that ordered millions of Sputnik V doses. In light green are the countries that have shown interest in obtaining the vaccine.
A COVID‑19 vaccine is any of several different vaccine technologies intended to provide acquired immunity against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). Previous work to develop a vaccine against the coronavirus diseases SARS and MERS established knowledge about the structure and function of coronaviruses, which accelerated development during early 2020 of varied technology platforms for a COVID‑19 vaccine.[375]
Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) scientists reported in September 2020, that nine different technology platforms  – with the technology of numerous candidates remaining undefined  – were under research and development during 2020, to create an effective vaccine against COVID‑19.[376] According to CEPI, most of the platforms of vaccine candidates in clinical trials as of September are focused on the coronavirus spike protein and its variants as the primary antigen of COVID‑19 infection.[376] Platforms being developed in 2020, involve nucleic acid technologies (RNA and DNA), non-replicating viral vectors, peptides, recombinant proteins, live attenuated viruses, and inactivated viruses.[375][376][377][378]

Only one vaccine, Sputnik V, developed by a research institute in Moscow, has been approved for use in Russia but it has not completed phase III trials.[379]
Medications
Main article: COVID-19 drug repurposing research

At least 29 Phase II–IV efficacy trials in COVID-19 were concluded in March 2020, or scheduled to provide results in April from hospitals in China.[380][381] There are more than 300 active clinical trials underway as of April 2020.[105] Seven trials were evaluating already approved treatments, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.[381] Repurposed antiviral drugs make up most of the research, with nine Phase III trials on remdesivir across several countries due to report by the end of April.[380][381] Other candidates in trials include vasodilators, corticosteroids, immune therapies, lipoic acid, bevacizumab, and recombinant angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.[381]

The COVID-19 Clinical Research Coalition has goals to 1) facilitate rapid reviews of clinical trial proposals by ethics committees and national regulatory agencies, 2) fast-track approvals for the candidate therapeutic compounds, 3) ensure standardised and rapid analysis of emerging efficacy and safety data and 4) facilitate sharing of clinical trial outcomes before publication.[382][383]

Several existing medications are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19,[352] including remdesivir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.[358][384] There is tentative evidence for efficacy by remdesivir, and on 1 May 2020, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave the drug an emergency use authorization (EUA) for people hospitalized with severe COVID-19.[385] On 28 August 2020, the FDA broadened the EUA for remdesivir to include all hospitalized patients with suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, irrespective of the severity of their disease.[386] Phase III clinical trials for several drugs[which?] are underway[when?] in several countries, including the US, China, and Italy.[352][380][387]

There are mixed results as of 3 April 2020, as to the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19, with some studies showing little or no improvement.[388][389] One study has shown an association between hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine use with higher death rates along with other side effects.[390][391] A retraction of this study by its authors was published by The Lancet on 4 June 2020.[392] The studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from embracing these therapies without further study.[105] On 15 June 2020, the FDA updated the fact sheets for the emergency use authorization of remdesivir to warn that using chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with remdesivir may reduce the antiviral activity of remdesivir.[393]

In June, initial results from a randomised trial in the United Kingdom showed that dexamethasone reduced mortality by one third for patients who are critically ill on ventilators and one fifth for those receiving supplemental oxygen.[394] Because this is a well tested and widely available treatment this was welcomed by the WHO that is in the process of updating treatment guidelines to include dexamethasone or other steroids.[395][396] Based on those preliminary results, dexamethasone treatment has been recommended by the National Institutes of Health for patients with COVID-19 who are mechanically ventilated or who require supplemental oxygen but not in patients with COVID-19 who do not require supplemental oxygen.[397]

In September 2020, the WHO released updated guidance on using corticosteroids for COVID-19.[398] The WHO recommends systemic corticosteroids rather than no systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of people with severe and critical COVID-19 (strong recommendation, based on moderate certainty evidence).[398] The WHO suggests not to use corticosteroids in the treatment of people with non-severe COVID-19 (conditional recommendation, based on low certainty evidence).[398] The updated guidance was based on a meta-analysis of clinical trials of critically ill COVID-19 patients.[399][400]

In September 2020, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) endorsed the use of dexamethasone in adults and adolescents (from twelve years of age and weighing at least 40 kg) who require supplemental oxygen therapy.[401] Dexamethasone can be taken by mouth or given as an injection or infusion (drip) into a vein.[401]

In November 2020, a US National Institutes of Health clinical trial evaluating the safety and effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has formally concluded that the drug provides no clinical benefit to hospitalized patients.[402]

In November 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use authorization for the investigational monoclonal antibody therapy bamlanivimab for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19.[403] Bamlanivimab is authorized for people with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing who are twelve years of age and older weighing at least 40 kilograms (88 lb), and who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 or hospitalization.[403] This includes those who are 65 years of age or older, or who have certain chronic medical conditions.[403]
