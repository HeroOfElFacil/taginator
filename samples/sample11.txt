Anticipation for the Cyberpunk 2077 release date couldn’t have been higher. CD Projekt Red had kept us waiting for years to find out, so when Keanu Reeves showed up at E3 2019 to reveal it, alongside the fact he’ll be playing Johnny Silverhand, we went somewhat into overdrive.

Alongside that, we got a good peep at more gameplay footage and a four-hour Cyberpunk 2077 preview, which builds upon the E3 2018 demo that showed Cyberpunk 2077 is the answer to, perhaps, the biggest game development question of the decade: how do you follow up something like The Witcher 3? Polish RPG powerhouse CD Projekt Red is looking to replicate its successes with Eastern Europe’s beloved fantasy book series by turning its hand to the futuristic world of Cyberpunk 2077.

CD Projekt Red’s videogame is an adaptation of the Cyberpunk 2020 pen-and-paper game. It’s a first-person RPG set in a gritty, vast future metropolis known as Night City. Like The Witcher 3, it’s an adult story, touching on drugs, violence, and social politics. It’s almost certainly going to be the most talked-about game of 2020 when it finally releases this year. Here’s everything we know about Cyberpunk 2077.
Cyberpunk 2077 release date

The official Cyberpunk 2077 release date is December 10, 2020. That means there’s not long left to wait until we’re able to explore the seedy underbelly of Night City.

Originally due out on April 16, the game has since been delayed three times – first to September 17, then to November 19th, and perhaps finally to December 10.

According to a recent report, CD Projekt Red has introduced mandatory overtime for Cyberpunk 2077.

The most recent gameplay trailer shows off the glitz and grit of various Night City locations, and introduces V as an “urban mercenary; a cyber-enhanced gun-for-hire”. It shows off some action-packed combat, hacking, and driving – and also introduces the crux of Cyberpunk 2077’s story. After you steal an incredibly valuable prototype biochip, its sealed container is damaged, and the only way to safely preserve it is by inserting it into your head – however, it also happens to come with the “digitized soul” of Johnny Silverhand, the legendary rockerboy played by Keanu Reeves. How this struggle for control plays out will depend on your choices throughout the game.

Cyberpunk 2077 gameplay first debuted behind closed doors at E3, and CD Projekt Red showcased the same demo to a select few at Gamescom. Soon after the developers have revealed that footage to the general public. You can view it in full below.

In it we see one of Cyberpunk 2077’s side missions play out, and quite how much the game owes to the pen-and-paper RPGs from which it takes inspiration. Our character, V, is given the task from famed Fixer, Dexter DeShawn to take an expensive spider bot drone, by any means necessary.

The bot, it turns out, is part of a haul stolen from Militech by the Maelstrom gang. The mission sees you play off both groups in either a peaceful or violent way, or an approach somewhere in between. We also get a proper introduction to the seedy underbelly – and overbelly, really – of Night City both on foot and on four wheels, and a visual representation of how weapon and character upgrades work.

CD Projekt Red livestreamed 15 minutes of a gameplay demo for Cyberpunk 2077, including snippets of already seen footage at Gamescom, plus new content, characters, and different play styles you can adopt along the way. The footage is designed to exclude spoilers, but does include new character information and reveals a part of the map, Pacifica. You can watch the full deep dive video below.

While we could admire Geralt’s shock of white hair in the third-person The Witcher 3, Cyberpunk 2077 is a first-person RPG – and we mean 100% first-person. You will have three main types of Cyberpunk 2077 weapons that include melee weapons and high-tech guns, and you will indulge in a bit of Watch-Dogs-style scanning and, with the right Cyberpunk 2077 abilities, plenty of hacking.

While you’ll be flooded with upgrade options for V’s skill tree, including Cyberpunk 2077 cyberware and your own Cyberpunk 2077 cyberdeck, that same level of customisation, however, won’t be found in their apartment. According to Polish games magazine PSX Extreme (spotted by DSO Gaming on Reddit), lead quest designer Paweł Sasko says “decorating your apartment doesn’t really go well with the vision of a dark and gritty spirit of the game”.

You also have two types of Cyberpunk 2077 XP: core XP and ‘Street Cred’. The former is earned by completing main missions, but you only build Street Cred by completing side missions. You can then spend your special experience points to access new vendors and Fixers, a special type of quest giver. You can also boost your Street Cred with Cyberpunk 2077 gear, which includes designer clothing that will grant you elemental defense stats.

Given what’s most likely going to be a gargantuan world, you’re going to need a way to get around. Usefully, then, we have plenty of Cyberpunk 2077 vehicles such as armoured-plated cars and motorbikes to better explore the world, and action-packed car chases. Unfortunately, you will not be able to control any of the flying vehicles in the world, but you will be able to steal cars to rapidly get around Night City  and there will be multiple Cyberpunk 2077 radio stations to listen to, featuring bespoke tracks from artists such as Grimes, Run the Jewels, SOPHIE, and Nina Kraviz. CD Projekt Red also say that there will be no loading screens to get in the way of your exploration of this handcrafted game world.

In terms of Cyberpunk 2077 combat, we can expect everything from numbers popping out of enemies to a full destruction system to crop up during gun battles. There are weapons with smart-tracking bullets, weapons that can shoot through walls, and abilities that can hack enemies brains to mush, so you will have a variety of ways to take on every fight. A lot of your combat potential will be decided by which implants and augmentations you have equipped, but be wary of installing too many implants as you can develop Cyberpsychosis in Cyberpunk 2077.

Night City is a seedy spot where criminal Cyberpunk 2077 gangs often rule the roost, so how will you let your hair down after shooting up a gang hideout? Well, we know that there will be Cyberpunk 2077 romance options that allow you to flirt with NPCs and have one night stands with them. That the game has “full-frontal nudity” shouldn’t surprise Witcher 3 fans; Geralt did get around the block a few times. In fact, CDPR has even said that romances will unfurl like they did in the Witcher 3, and will have their own plot lines. On a totally unrelated note, CDPR is supposedly “planning” a Cyberpunk 2077 photo mode.

Regarding quest design, you can expect to complete some of them in three to five different ways. That comes from senior quest designer Philip Weber, who delved into Cyberpunk 2077’s mission design on a Reddit thread. Weber explains that Cyberpunk 2077’s class system has impacted the ways players can interact with the game’s missions. Weber then goes on to say that using the skills from these class systems “gives you more (as an example, three to five in some cases) ways how to solve a quest or challenges within a quest. This naturally makes quest designs more complex in some areas, but it’s honestly great fun to do.” It’s also worth adding that there will not be any procedurally generated quests in Cyberpunk 2077.

There are multiple ways you can start the game, too. You can choose a Cyberpunk 2077 life path, being either Nomad, Corpo, or Street Kid which will determine who you meet and which district you’ll start out in.

The Cyberpunk 2077 game over screen will only roll if your character dies, too – meaning that even if you’re tasked with escorting an individual, and that person dies, the world goes on the same. If you’re thinking that could lead to some silly hi-jinks, then you’ll likely find CD Projekt in agreement. In an interview with German outlet GameStar (translated on Reddit), Philipp Webser explains that quest designers asked themselves at every turn what the stupidest thing a player could do in that given moment – with missions then being built around that.

If we are lucky enough to enjoy an online component in Cyberpunk 2077 we would expect a co-op system similar to the one in Dark Souls, but we’d also be happy to destroy our real-life dystopian rivals in a good car chase through Night City.

CD Projekt Red has commented on the post-launch content, especially in relation to its predecessor, The Witcher 3. Cyberpunk 2077 DLC is set to be plentiful, as The Witcher 3 is praised for its DLC rollout, it looks like Cyberpunk 2077 will be, too. Cyberpunk 2077 players can expect “more DLC” than The Witcher 3 had and The Witcher 3 included two paid for expansions and a bunch of free content post-launch.
Cyberpunk 2077 steam

CD Projekt Red’s next game is, indeed, up for grabs on Steam, and you can grab your Steam pre-order now. In fact, it’s already topping the Steam wishlists chart. If you’d rather buy your games elsewhere, though, then Cyberpunk 2077 will also pop up on the Epic Store and, of course, GOG.
